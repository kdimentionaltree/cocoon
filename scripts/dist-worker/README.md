# COCOON Worker

You can run a COCOON worker to earn TON by serving AI models securely and in a verifiable manner.

## Prerequisites

- Linux server (**6.16+ for full TDX support**) with:
    - Intel TDX-capable CPU
    - NVIDIA GPU with CC support (H100+)
    - QEMU with TDX support (10.1+)

First, you should enable TDX and prepare your GPU for confidential computing. For this, you may refer to:

- [Enabling Intel TDX](https://cc-enabling.trustedservices.intel.com/intel-tdx-enabling-guide/03/hardware_selection/)
- [Enabling CC on NVIDIA GPU](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-admin-tools) - You may have to update your VBIOS for GPU attestation to fully work.

One straightforward way to prepare your hardware is to use the [Canonical guide](https://github.com/canonical/tdx), but it could be too specific for general use.

You may also find the `./scripts/setup-gpu-vfio` script helpful to prepare your GPU for confidential computing. Run it without arguments to see usage instructions.

## Quick Start

1. Download the COCOON worker distribution:
   ```bash
   wget https://ci.cocoon.org/cocoon-worker-release-latest.tar.xz 
   tar xvf cocoon-worker-release-latest.tar.xz 
   # cd release-<commit-hash>
   ```

2. Start seal-server (required for production):
   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal, run seal-server
   ./bin/seal-server --enclave-path ./bin/enclave.signed.so
   ```
   You may build your own `seal-server`, but `enclave.signed.so` MUST be from the archive.
   
   **Important:** `seal-server` must be running before starting the worker. It provides secure key derivation for the TDX guest. Leave it running in the background.

3. Create configuration:
   ```bash
   cp worker.conf.example worker.conf
   vim worker.conf  # Edit with your settings (see inline comments for details)
   ```

   All required options are documented in `worker.conf.example`. You may also pass them via command-line options to `cocoon-launch`.

4. Run worker:
   ```bash
   # Production mode (requires seal-server running)
   ./scripts/cocoon-launch worker.conf
   
   # Test mode (with debug shell, real TON)
   ./scripts/cocoon-launch --test worker.conf
   
   # Test mode (with debug shell, fake TON)
   ./scripts/cocoon-launch --test --fake-ton worker.conf
   ```

   You may override most of the config options via `cocoon-launch` options:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cocoon-launch --instance 1 --worker-coefficient 2000 --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B worker.conf
   ```

## Configuration

All options are set in `worker.conf` (INI format). See `worker.conf.example` for detailed comments.

### Required Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `type` | Node type (always `worker` for workers) |
| `model` | AI model to serve (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) |
| `owner_address` | Your TON wallet address (receives payments) |
| `gpu` | GPU PCI address (find with: `lspci \| grep -i nvidia`) |
| `node_wallet_key` | Private key for revenue wallet (base64, keep private!) |
| `hf_token` | Hugging Face token (get from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)) |
| `ton_config` | Path to TON network config file (see below) |
| `root_contract_address` | COCOON root contract address on TON |

### Optional Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `instance` | `0` | Instance number for running multiple workers |
| `worker_coefficient` | `1000` | Price coefficient (1000 = 1.0x) |
| `persistent` | `persistent-worker-{instance}.img` | Persistent disk image path |

### TON Network Configuration

The `ton_config` option must point to a JSON file containing TON network configuration with reliable liteserver endpoints.

You may use the [configuration we provide](https://cocoon.org/resources/mainnet.cocoon.global.config.json) or supply your own. 

Example:
```bash
# Use included mainnet config
ton_config = mainnet-config.json

# Or use custom config
ton_config = /path/to/custom-config.json
```

**What is root_contract_address?**

This is the address of the COCOON root smart contract on TON blockchain. It contains:
- List of allowed TDX image hashes
- List of supported model hashes
- Proxy addresses for the network
- Network-wide configuration

The correct address for the current network is included in the distribution's `worker.conf.example`.

## Running Multiple Workers

Use the `instance` option to run multiple workers on the same machine (one per GPU).

Each instance automatically gets:
- Unique ports (12000, 12010, 12020, ...)
- Unique CIDs (6, 16, 26, ...)
- Separate persistent storage

Example:
```bash
# Worker 1 on GPU 0
./scripts/cocoon-launch --instance 0 --gpu 0000:01:00.0 worker.conf &

# Worker 2 on GPU 1
./scripts/cocoon-launch --instance 1 --gpu 0000:41:00.0 worker.conf &
```

## Optional WireGuard overlay

With an image containing the WireGuard service, add `wireguard_config = /path/to/worker-wireguard.json` to the worker configuration or pass `--wireguard-config FILE`. The launcher copies it into the measured spec and forwards encrypted UDP plus admission TCP with the normal instance offset. `backend = sglang` or `vllm` selects the measured engine service.

Enrollment exports and approved guest measurements must be signed by the pinned operator authority. Deliver the grant to the prepared runtime path printed by the launcher; the workers wait for admission and overlay readiness before serving. Follow the [WireGuard deployment runbook](../wireguard/README.md) for configuration, signing, renewal and recovery. Distributed inference rank launch is separate from this integration.

## seal-server

`seal-server` is required for production deployment. It runs on the host and provides secure key derivation for TDX guests.

**Why is it needed?**

Workers need persistent keys that:
- Survive VM reboots
- Are tied to the specific TDX image and configuration
- Cannot be accessed by the host

`seal-server` uses an SGX enclave to derive these keys based on the TDX guest's attestation.

**How to run:**

```bash
# Start seal-server (keep it running)
./seal-server --enclave-path enclave.so
```

**Important:**
- Must use the `enclave.so` file included in the distribution (exact same binary)
- Must be running before starting any workers
- One `seal-server` instance can serve multiple workers
- Without `seal-server`, workers will fail to initialize

**For test mode:** `seal-server` is not required when using `--test --fake-ton` flags.

## Monitoring

### HTTP Stats

Access worker statistics via HTTP:

```bash
# Worker instance 0
curl http://localhost:12000/stats
curl http://localhost:12000/jsonstats  # JSON format

# Worker instance 1
curl http://localhost:12010/stats
```

Available endpoints:
- `/stats` - Human-readable statistics
- `/jsonstats` - JSON-formatted statistics
- `/perf` - Performance metrics

### health-client

For detailed monitoring, use `health-client`:

```bash
# Check worker health
./health-client --instance worker status

# View system metrics
./health-client -i worker sys

# View GPU metrics
./health-client -i worker gpu

# View service logs
./health-client -i worker logs cocoon-vllm 100

# Get all metrics
./health-client -i worker all
```

Run `./health-client --help` for complete usage information.
